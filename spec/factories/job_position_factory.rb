            A passion for taking part in open source projects
            
            Why It’s An Awesome Gig
            
            Make JavaScript matter. Help elevate JavaScript to the level of its more respected brethren through unit tests, headless testing, and by contributing to core libraries authored and maintained by many of the world's best engineers.
            Take part in emerging methodologies. Author and contribute to a slew of proprietary implementations of the latest front-end development methodologies — custom-built for one of the world’s most widely-watched tech companies.
            Lead the charge in accessibility. Be on the forefront of implementing truly accessible content at scale. And with this client, ‘at scale’ means really, really big.
            Craft pixel-perfect, butter-smooth animations. Leverage the team's shared knowledge to exploit all the quirks of modern browsers for animations that perform consistently and beautifully.
            Never open Photoshop again. Ever. We’re serious. And yes, it’s awesome. This client has entire teams dedicated to slicing and exporting all images before we ever begin development.
            And build new skills day after day. Get allocated time for personal development and exploration in a highly collaborative, growth-facilitating environment — complete with manager/peer code-reviews, and exclusive dev talks and symposiums.
